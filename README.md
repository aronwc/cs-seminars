**old_talks.py**    
I imported these using `python export_old_talks.py`, which scrapes some of the talks from http://cs.iit.edu/~mbilgic/seminar/. 

The talks are maintained in a Google Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IkZE3vwt0T7TbxbVfKIoVsYFdA2A-whGs8j7mRpkgY/edit#gid=0

These are then automatically imported into a Google Calendar with id:  iit.edu_sbnenhe2kqri611q823ovopiu0@group.calendar.google.com

This is done by a Google App Script:
